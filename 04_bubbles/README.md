# Bubbles

This sketch builds on [my first sketch of three circles](https://github.com/williammlekush/Software-Art-Image/tree/main/01_three_circles). This is a first step toward an animation inspired by a piece we watched in class. I hope to sync the visuals with an audio component from a piece I made several years ago. For now, the circiles endlessling oscillate between two sizes. And now, you can easily find new compositions by pressing 'r'.
