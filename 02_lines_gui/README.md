# Stubborn Etch-a-sketch

Inspired by the Etch-a-Sketch toy, this program generates a moving line that you can turn! The only catch, it turns in a random direction. You can also control the color and thickness of the lines using a simple GUI. Turn the line by pressing 'r'. The result is a frustrating experience that gradually becomes a fun collaboration, playing with density, depth, and composition.
